Going Out Tonight
Changes Into Something Red
Her Mother Doesn't Like That Kind Of Dress
Everything She Never Had She's Showing Off

Driving Too Fast
Moon Is Breaking Through Her Hair
She's Heading For Something
That She Won't Forget
Having No Regrets Is All
That She Really Wants

We're Only Getting Older, Baby
And I've Been Thinking About It Lately
Does It Ever Drive You Crazy
Just How Fast The Night Changes?
Everything That You've Ever Dreamed Of
Disappearing When You Wake Up
But There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Even When The Night Changes
It Will Never Change Me And You

Chasing It Tonight,
Doubts Are Running 'round Her Head
He's Waiting, Hides Behind A Cigarette
Heart Is Beating Loud,
And She Doesn't Want It To Stop

Moving Too Fast
Moon Is Lighting Up Her Skin
She's Falling, Doesn't Even Know It Yet
Having No Regrets Is All That She Really Wants

We're Only Getting Older, Baby
And I've Been Thinking About It Lately
Does It Ever Drive You Crazy
Just How Fast The Night Changes?
Everything That You've Ever Dreamed Of
Disappearing When You Wake Up
But There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Even When The Night Changes
It Will Never Change Me And You

Going Out Tonight
Changes Into Something Red
Her Mother Doesn't Like That Kind Of Dress
Reminds Her Of The Missing Piece
Of Innocence She Lost

We're Only Getting Older, Baby
And I've Been Thinking About It Lately
Does It Ever Drive You Crazy
Just How Fast The Night Changes?
Everything That You've Ever Dreamed Of
Disappearing When You Wake Up
But There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Even When The Night Changes
It Will Never Change, Baby
It Will Never Change, Baby
It Will Never Change Me And You
